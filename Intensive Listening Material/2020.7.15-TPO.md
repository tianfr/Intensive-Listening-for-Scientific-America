I'm writing my paper about the whales, and paths they traval as they swim though the ocean, their migration patterns.

it is a little crazy for me to be  writing a paper about migration patterns, without actually knowing how the stay underwater for so long.

It's just a matter of certain adaptations in their atanomy, specifically in their circulartory system.

yes, and in a couple of ways. First blood makes up a larger share of whale's weight than in the other mammals

so how does having more oxygen in their blood help them stay underwater longer
