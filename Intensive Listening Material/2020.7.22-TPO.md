I'm just filling out this approval-for-graduation form for dean's office and I don't know, I hope I'm able to be graduate next semester.

we make sure that student who had finished their second year, that is those who were in third or forth year wont be affected.

just to be on the safe side, why don't you talk to someone in the dean's office before you give them the form.
