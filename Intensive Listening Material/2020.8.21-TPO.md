# TPO18 Conversation1
## Grade: 3/5

My family hosted a few foreign-exchange students when I was going up.

I thought I'd save money, being away from the big city but it doesn't seem to working that way.

most of our campus jobs are taken in the first week or two of the semester.

They said their remaining positions were for work-study students getting financial aid

I never run to that before.

I helped teach some of the basic computer classes northeastern offers for new users if that helps any.

The technoloy support department need people to work at its helpdesk.

something every diplomat needs

you'd probably end up with a bit of everything rather than a regular spot.

on the bright sight, you probably be able to get some studying down between calls.

But I guess I can't afford to be too picky if I wanna a job.

still maybe we can work something out.
